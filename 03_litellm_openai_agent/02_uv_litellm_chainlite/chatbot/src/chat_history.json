    "content": "Allama Muhammad Iqbal, widely known as Allama Iqbal, was a prominent poet, philosopher, and politician in British India. He is credited with inspiring the Pakistan Movement and is revered as the \"Poet of the East\" and \"National Poet of Pakistan.\"\n\nHere are some key aspects of his life and work:\n\n*   **Poetry:** Iqbal wrote extensively in Urdu and Persian, exploring themes of self-discovery, spirituality, Islamic revival, and the importance of individual and collective action. His works include \"Asrar-e-Khudi\" (Secrets of the Self), \"Rumuz-e-Bekhudi\" (Secrets of Selflessness), \"Bang-e-Dara,\" \"Bal-e-Jibril,\" and \"Zarb-i Kalim.\"\n*   **Philosophy:** Iqbal's philosophical ideas were deeply rooted in Islamic thought, but he also engaged with Western philosophy. He emphasized the concept of \"Khudi\" (the self) and the development of a strong individual identity within a spiritual and moral framework.\n*   **Political Thought:** Iqbal advocated for the creation of a separate Muslim state in the Indian subcontinent. His 1930 presidential address to the All-India Muslim League is considered a landmark in the Pakistan Movement, where he articulated the need for a separate homeland for Muslims.\n*   **Influence:** Iqbal's writings and ideas had a profound impact on the Muslim community in British India and continue to inspire people around the world. He is considered one of the most important figures in the intellectual and cultural history of the region."

    "content": "The errors you're seeing from Pylance (the Python language server in VS Code) are \"reportMissingImports\" errors. This means that your Python code is trying to import modules (\"chainlit\", \"litellm\", and \"dotenv\"), but Pylance can't find them in your Python environment.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each error means and how to fix them:\n\n*   **\"Import \\\"chainlit\\\" could not be resolved\"**:  The `chainlit` library is not installed. Chainlit is a Python framework for building conversational AI applications.\n\n*   **\"Import \\\"litellm\\\" could not be resolved\"**: The `litellm` library is not installed. Litellm is a library to standardize LLM calls\n\n*   **\"Import \\\"dotenv\\\" could not be resolved\"**: The `dotenv` library is not installed. `dotenv` is a library that allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file, which is a common practice for managing API keys and other sensitive information.\n\n**How to fix these errors:**\n\nThe solution to all these errors is the same: **Install the missing Python packages using `pip` (or `conda`, if you're using Anaconda).**\n\nHere's how:\n\n1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt:**  This is where you'll run the `pip` commands.\n\n2.  **Install the packages:**  Run the following commands one by one:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install chainlit\n    pip install litellm\n    pip install python-dotenv\n    ```\n\n    *   **If you are using Anaconda:**  You might need to use `conda install`:\n\n        ```bash\n        conda install -c conda-forge chainlit\n        conda install -c conda-forge litellm\n        conda install -c conda-forge python-dotenv\n        ```\n        The `-c conda-forge` specifies the conda-forge channel, which is a community-driven repository that often has packages not available in the default Anaconda channel.\n\n3.  **Verify the installation (optional):**  After installing, you can check if the packages are installed correctly:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip show chainlit\n    pip show litellm\n    pip show python-dotenv\n    ```\n\n    This will display information about each installed package, including its version and location.  If you see the information, the installation was successful.\n\n4.  **Reload or restart VS Code:**  Sometimes, VS Code needs to be restarted or the Python environment needs to be reloaded for Pylance to recognize the newly installed packages. Try closing and reopening VS Code, or try reloading the window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`, then type \"Reload Window\" and select it).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Virtual Environments:**  It's *highly* recommended to use virtual environments in Python projects.  Virtual environments isolate your project's dependencies from the global Python environment, preventing conflicts. If you're not already using a virtual environment, create one:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv .venv  # Creates a virtual environment named \".venv\"\n    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS\n    .venv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n    ```\n\n    Then, install the packages within the activated virtual environment.\n\n*   **`requirements.txt`:** For larger projects, it's good practice to use a `requirements.txt` file to list all the project's dependencies. You can create this file using:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip freeze > requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n    Then, to install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, you can use:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Import could not be resolved\" errors and get your Python code running correctly. Remember to always install packages within a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies effectively.\n"
